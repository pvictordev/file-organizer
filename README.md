# File Organizer

This is a simple file organizer script. Run it whenever you feel your folder is getting messy.

## Steps to Run

1. Clone the repository with:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
2. Open the folder and navigate to the dist folder:
   ```bash
   cd dist
   ```

- Alternatively, you can download only the dist folder, open it in the terminal, and proceed from there

3. Run the executable  
   3.1 Enter the path of the directory to organize: /path/to/folder:
   ```bash
   ./main /path/to/folder
   ```
   3.2 Run the executable inside the folder where the binary is located
   ```bash
   ./main
   ```
